<h1 align="center">Standard Rates </h1>
<p style="font-size:22px">The standard charges rate for delivery services can vary depending on several factors 
    such as distance, weight, size, urgency, type of goods, and delivery location. 
    Additionally, different delivery companies may have their own pricing models based on their 
    operational costs, market demand, and competitive landscape.</p>
<p style="font-size:22px">However, as a general rule of thumb, most delivery services charge based on the following criteria:</p>
<p style="font-size:22px">1.Distance: The further the distance, the higher the delivery cost. This is because the delivery company 
    has to spend more time and resources to transport the package to the destination.</p>
<p style="font-size:22px">2.Weight and size: The heavier and bulkier the package, the more it costs to transport. This is because 
    the delivery company has to use more fuel and manpower to handle and transport the package.</p>
<p style="font-size:22px">3.Urgency: If the package needs to be delivered quickly or within a specific time frame, the delivery 
    company may charge a higher fee for expedited delivery.</p>
<p style="font-size:22px">4.Type of goods: Certain types of goods may require special handling, packaging, or
     transportation, which may increase the delivery cost.</p>
<P style="font-size:22px">5.Delivery location: Some delivery locations may be more challenging to access or require additional permits,
     which may increase the delivery cost.</P>
<p style="font-size:22px">Overall, the standard charges rate for delivery services can vary widely depending on these factors. It is 
    best to research different delivery companies and compare their pricing and services to find the best fit 
    for your needs and budget.</p>
