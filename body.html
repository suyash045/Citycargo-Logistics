    <h1 align ="center"> Postal Service</h1>
    <p style="font-size:20px">Postal services refer to the system of collecting, transporting, sorting, processing, and 
       delivering mail and parcels between individuals and businesses, using a network of post offices,
        mailboxes,  and delivery vehicles. Postal services typically offer a range of options for sending mail,
         such as standard or express delivery, tracking, insurance, and various types of packaging.
         In addition to traditional paper mail, many postal services also handle electronic mail and 
         provide other services such as money transfers, bill payment, and passport applications.</p>

    <h1 align ="center">Courier service</h1>
    <p style="font-size:20px">Courier service refers to a specialized delivery service that provides fast, secure, and 
        reliable transportation of documents, packages, and other goods from one location to another.
         Unlike traditional postal services, courier services typically offer same-day or next-day delivery options,
          and often use a dedicated vehicle or courier to ensure speedy and secure delivery. Courier services may also
        offer real-time tracking of shipments, proof of delivery. </p>

    <h1 align ="center">Fast Post Service</h1>
    <p style="font-size:20px">Fast post refers to a postal service that provides expedited delivery of mail and packages within a shorter 
        timeframe than standard postal services. Fast post services are designed for customers who require their items 
        to be delivered quickly and reliably, and typically offer faster processing, transportation, and delivery times 
        than regular postal services. Depending on the provider, fast post services may offer same-day, next-day, or 
        two-day delivery options, as well as tracking and other value-added services.</p>

    <h1 align ="center">Fragile Item Shipment Service</h1>
    <p style="font-size:20px">ragile item shipment refers to the transportation of goods that are delicate, vulnerable, and require special handling 
        and packaging to ensure they arrive at their destination without damage. Fragile items can include glassware, ceramics,
         electronics, artwork, antiques, and other valuable items that are easily breakable or sensitive to movement, pressure, 
        or temperature changes. To ensure the safe transportation of fragile items, special packaging materials such as bubble wrap, 
        foam, and sturdy boxes are used to provide extra protection.</p>
